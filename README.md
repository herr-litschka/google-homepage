This was a project replicating the Google homepage. The template for this project was the Google homepage https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759if_/https://www.google.com/. I used grid most of the time to place the objects with flexbox being used once to place the search buttons. I was able to recreate all the styles which are used on the Google homepage.
